# Understanding and Predicting Property Maintenance Fines

__Objective__: to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.

This assignment is based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](https://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)).

The Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](https://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences ([MSSISS](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mssiss/)) have partnered with the City of Detroit to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing Detroit - blight. [Blight violations](https://data.detroitmi.gov/Property-Parcels/Blight-Violations/ti6p-wcg4/data) are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?

The first step in answering this question is understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket. This is where predictive modeling comes in.

All data has been provided to us through the [Detroit Open Data Portal](https://data.detroitmi.gov/).
